# ðŸ”¥ Text Analytics on MAMA EARTH Dataset

What type of hackathon is this? This hackathon was organized by GDSC (Google Developement Student Chapter), and our team "Team WordWizards" achieved 2nd place. As the title suggests, it's focused on NLP (Natural Language Processing). We were provided with a dataset from MAMA EARTH consisting of over 31,000 rows. Our task was to analyze these samples to gain insights, identify issues, and propose strategies to increase sales
## Problem Statement
Analyzing customer reviews using sentiment analysis to derive a Good Factor Index, categorizing products by type and state, and evaluating state-wise product performance to identify reasons for low sales or negative feedback, aiming to propose targeted strategies for improvement
## Who are we...?
This is Our Certificate of Appreciation

### OK Fine lets Talk about solution and this repo
so in this repo there is python script named app.py, which content all the streamlit code, also jupyter notebooks where we worked to get insight from, follow following steps to run this app locally on your machine...

Firstly clone this repo
```
git clone https://github.com/prafuel/TensorFiesta_Hackathon.git
cd TensorFiesta_Hackathon
```
Install all the dependency (Bro tip : Use virtual enviroment)
``` 
pip install requirements.txt
```
Lastly Run
```
streamlit run app.py
```
UI is very self explanatory and just go through source code, dataset is also available if needed just get it, there will be clean_dataset too

In Future we are also working to add llm pretrained model to fetch details about all the graphs in easily understandable by any human and get business insight from it
### Stay Tunned...
